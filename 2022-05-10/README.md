## Abstract

Howard Smith, CTO of the Computer Science Corporation (CSC), published in 2006
a series of 11 essays in which he presents his view of the application of TRIZ
to Business Process Management (BPM in Howard's abbreviation).  He emphasises
in particular the role of TRIZ as a methodology for engineering-based planning
processes to update Business Process Landscapes and thus ultimately to further
development of Business Models.

Since the modelling of Business Processes is itself already concerned with
intra-company dynamics and thus does concern not only _functional_ aspects,
innovation projects are about _systemic_ development processes, which
themselves have to be considered under a systemic aspect if the required
systemic transformations are not to take place solely on the basis of
brainstorming and trial-error. Howard Smith sees these challenges of a
Systematic Innovation Methodology as a further development stage of Business
Process Management.
