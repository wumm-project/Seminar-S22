## Abstract

Howard Smith, CTO of the Computer Science Corporation (CSC), published in 2006
a series of 11 essays in which he presents his view of the application of TRIZ
to Business Process Management (BPM in Howard's abbreviation).  He emphasises
in particular the role of TRIZ as a methodology for engineering-based planning
processes to update Business Process Landscapes and thus ultimately to further
development of Business Models.

Since the modelling of Business Processes is itself already concerned with
intra-company dynamics and thus does concern not only _functional_ aspects,
innovation projects are about _systemic_ development processes, which
themselves have to be considered under a systemic aspect if the required
systemic transformations are not to take place solely on the basis of
brainstorming and trial-error. Howard Smith sees these challenges of a
Systematic Innovation Methodology as a further development stage of Business
Process Management.

## Notes

In the discussion, the main question was to what extent the programme outlined
by H. Smith in 2006 has been implemented in the meantime.

__Trends:__ The separation of trends of technical development (the original
focus of TRIZ) and business trends is not as strict as it may seem at a first
glance. Already in (Altshuller 1979) the first version of _Trends of
Engineering System Evolution_ (TESE) is derived from the S-curve model, which
(qualitatively) displays the _economic_ success of a technical system
(considered as a product class on a mass market) over time. In the MATRIZ
standard reference (TESE 2018), this orientation towards the economic success
of technical developments is deepened once again. Chapter 1 deals with
"Technology Pull: Beyond Technology Push and Market Pull". However, the
referenced economic-theoretical approaches date back to the 1970s, as
explained in more detail in (Gr채be 2020).

The transfer of TESE to trends in the business sector has been discussed
several times, for example in (Wagner 2021). However, it is primarily a matter
of grasping the economic effects of technical developments as an _integral
socio-technical problem_ and deriving necessities for business process
innovation not only from market observations, but also to understand the
technically conditioned effects on manufacturing processes, value
propositions, etc. in more detail. Trends do not only express causal
explanation patterns _in theory_, but also stand for _practical relevant_
breaking down of experiences and recommendations for action as well as for a
more precise description of appropriate use cases, see again (Wagner 2021).

__Business Process Modelling (BPM):__ Here the question was to what extent not
only _functional_ but also _processual_ aspects are taken up in these
approaches. TRIZ tend to struggle with such approaches (see the last seminar).
Here, however, it quickly became clear that BPM is also primarily
_structurally_ oriented as all systemic approaches of the first kind, even at
the level of sequence diagrams with apparent _process_ orientation.
Non-functional requirements such as throughput rates, response times, etc. are
also difficult to represent in BPM.

Even though such aspects are certainly taken into account in simulations, the
relevant scientific communities seem to act largely separately and hardly take
notice of each other.
