## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   Knowledge
* __Presenter:__ Cecilia Graiff

## Abstract

In the lecture, the importance of shared conceptual systems as well as the
development and management of shared description forms, both structural and
procedural, as the _context_ of cooperative action was emphasised. There is a
close connection between the feedback cycle of justified expectations and
experienced results in action on the one hand and the further development of
that cooperative knowledge base on the other.  TRIZ itself is a good example
of this process of co-development as a combination of a general methodology
with concrete domain-specific applications.

In Chapter 16 "Knowledge", Darrell Mann discusses primarily questions of the
organisation and tool-based search in modern, digitally available knowledge
bases. Somewhat underexposed is the problem of the maintenance and development
of corresponding knowledge bases in the company and the role of _Data
Architects_ as a newly emerging professional group.

## From the Chat

What about the relation between knowledge and skills?

What concepts of data and knowledge are used here? What's about information?
What's about data and management (JÃ¼ttner's talk)?

Information appears only on slide 8, is it a second-order notion? Infomation
as the result of a search?  What's about slide 14? Is this a very different
concept? What's about the critics of the pyramide approach in the lecture? One
can "access data", but knowledge?

subject - action - object
- What's about cooperative action of cooperative subjects?

Functions as verbs. Connection between things. What are "things"?  What about
classes of things and multiple applicability of functions?

What is the difference to the Entity-Relationship approach well established in
database science which starts from entities?

Slide 6: Classification of verbs. What's about classification of objects?

Why this classification of verbs plays such a central role for Darrell Mann
unter the heading "knowlegde"? What is the relation between verbs and
knowledge?

Slide 10: Are there topics that you never will try to search by Google? 

Why Google knows what is relevant for _you_?

Slide 12: What is the relationship between "taxonomies or ontologies" and
"contexts"?  Taxonomies are general, contexts are situation-specific hence
special?

Silde 13: One user - one context? What's about our observation in the lecture
that each user has several digital identities?

Slide 15: Souchkov writes not "successful application" but "skillful
application". Is this a different concept?

Slide 16: TRIZ abstraction is usually not about "... solved this problem" but
about "... solved a similar problem" (general situation).  Is this a
difference?

TRIZ claims "to solve problems" not to be a "knowledge framework".
- TRIZ is a methodological framework that can be applied to problem solving in
  different domains.  But is does not work without domain-specific knowledge.
  And the domain-specific problem can be solved without TRIZ methodology.

Slide 17: What's the relation to "experience management" and "the practically
proved" that should be turned into "proved practices" (i.e. to be
institutionalised)?

Slide 18: "solved this problem" ... "rely on functions". A central point of
TRIZ (Function Analysis), but what about _operational_ conditions and turning
functions in processes?

Is there "cooperative knowledge"? Mann focuses on verbs - hence action.  So
"cooperate knowledge" is mainly contained in institutionalised processes?

guest:
- I would at least frame it like this: Accessing knowledge is a systemic
  process
- Is knowledge really contextfree? Have I understood this here right?
- so there is domain knowledge and kind of generalizable knowledge?
- is 'wisdom' maybe something like 'competence'?
