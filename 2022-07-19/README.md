## Abstract

In the lecture, the importance of shared conceptual systems as well as the
development and management of shared description forms, both structural and
procedural, as the _context_ of cooperative action was emphasised. There is a
close connection between the feedback cycle of justified expectations and
experienced results in action on the one hand and the further development of
that cooperative knowledge base on the other.  TRIZ itself is a good example
of this process of co-development as a combination of a general methodology
with concrete domain-specific applications.

In Chapter 16 "Knowledge", Darrell Mann discusses primarily questions of the
organisation and tool-based search in modern, digitally available knowledge
bases. Somewhat underexposed is the problem of the maintenance and development
of corresponding knowledge bases in the company and the role of _Data
Architects_ as a newly emerging professional group.
