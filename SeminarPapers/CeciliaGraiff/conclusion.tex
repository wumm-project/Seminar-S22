\chapter{Conclusion}
Knowledge access, storing and management are difficult and multidisciplinary tasks. Mann's theories combine the fundamental questions of this field, like finding the borders between knowledge and wisdom - which involves sociology, philosophy, economics, informatics, only to cite some of the most relevant subjects - with a practical proposal for a problem-solving process, which allows the connection with TRIZ. The author's theses sometimes lack accuracy or do not take into account some important aspects of the problems; However, this is often due either to the complexity of the field - which makes it nearly impossible to embrace each and every of its features - or to the purpose of the book, which is focused on application to business models and often chooses not to indulge in too many technical details. Nevertheless, Mann's chapter on Knowledge is able to unite thought-provoking parts and a practical guide to knowledge search and management.
