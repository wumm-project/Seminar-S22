\chapter{Conclusion}

To conclude the why, what and how of measuring in the business context, Darrell Mann ends this chapter with his own experiences.
Measurement methods often only need to be reconsidered when a system is in its evolutionary development or when a new function is added to an existing system.
If these stages are suffering from inadequate feedback and control mechanisms, it is important to reconsider ones strategies.
To create appropriate measurement it is best to define in simple functional terms the required data from the system.
Always keep the main useful function in mind and whether a measurement serves to help control this function.
