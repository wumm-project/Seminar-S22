## Notes from the Chat

- You only examine "real" energy companies, not pure "market players" like
  Energy2Market or Lichtblick?
  
- Where do you get the "new business models" from?

- Up to what percentage of renewable energy does it work? What about 100%
  renewables? Strong change of the business model through decentralised
  addition of photovoltaics.

- The sector is a typical example of how a managed infrastructure is the
  prerequisite for market action.  How is this difference in time horizons
  dealt with?
  - The model are mainly oriented on the operative level.

- Slide 9: This is the operating result (from three markets). How is this
  linked to investment commitments?
  - Average investment activities are part of the model. 

- The whole thing is a pure model? Digital twin means 'learning' must also be
  built in somehow.
  - At the moment it is mainly a simulation only.  Feedback is incorporated,
    e.g., through annual model updates.

- Variability of the customer model is specified and triggered by the energy
  provider as manager and operator of the infrastructure? How closely is the
  customer technically tied to the energy provider?  What role do
  "intermediaries" play?

- IRPAct: I understand this (in perspective) as a support system for
  _strategic_ decisions of the energy provider to what extent and at what
  times business model changes have to be addressed.

- To what extent are such agent models already used in the field of energy
  trading for practical management?  Is this comparable to agent modelling in
  high performance trading on various exchanges?
  - There is no information what the simulations are at these points.

- PVact: There are now leasing models for PV systems, which means that the
  threshold for investment is very low (venture capital via larger providers).

- Are the weights of the five sub-values also adjusted in the annual updates
  or only the U's?
  - Only the U's.  Adjustments of the weights require too large effort for
    corresponding studies.  Official annual studies are published to different
    aspects of change of the energy system.
