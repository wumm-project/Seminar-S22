## Abstract

The concept of resources is largely underexposed in TRIZ in contrast to
developed engineering domains where concrete specifications of resources as
well as questions of availability and management of resource pools in a
cross-company context (such as, e.g., the availability of chips in the
automotive industry) play a greater role. Darrell Mann's explanations remain
on the level of a rather general concept of resources of availabilities
without addressees, whereas today, especially in the B2B sector with ever more
refined supply chain structures, cross-company resource flows with
well-defined qualitative and quantitative characteristics are gaining in
importance.
