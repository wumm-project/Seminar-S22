## Abstract

Resilience is a systemic concept that focuses on the stability of a systemic
development context. Data-based monitoring is an important tool of resilience
management. However, resilience of a system depends on its external conditions
of existence and thus on the relationship of the system to one or more other
neighbouring systems, each with its own semantics. Resilience management in
socio-cultural ecosystems must therefore be able to evaluate data from
subsystems appropriately and “translate” it into its own semantics. The
metadata to be generated in this process is semantic-aware, as it transports
semantic aspects of the subsystem into the upper system and thus make it
available to the emergent functions developing there. The evaluation of this
metadata at the level of the upper system leads to new data, which in turn
unfold its effect in the subsystems as semantic-aware metadata.

In the presentation conceptual aspects of the development of semantics at
different systemic levels and its impact on generation and use of metadata in
a system to access and manage data collections in subsystems are discussed.
