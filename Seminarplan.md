## Seminar themes:

1. Recent Advances in Business TRIZ

   __Goal:__ TRIZ is a contradiction oriented systemic innovation framework.
   Business TRIZ applies the general TRIZ approaches to resolve contraditions
   to business systems and business process landscapes. The main advances in
   the Conferences "Business TRIZ Online" 2021 and 2022 should be presented
   and discussed.
   
   __Literature:__ (Souchkov 2010), (Souchkov 2014),
   <http://www.biztriz.net/news.html>

2. Notational differences between SCOR and APQC PCF

   __Goal:__ APQC PCF, the APQC Process Classification Framework, is an
   industrial grade notational and classification framework for business
   processes that is in widespread use in particular in the anglo-saxonian
   world to support the conceptualisation of intra-company processes. SCOR,
   the Supply Chain Operations Reference Model, on the other hand ... 

   __Literature:__ (APQC), (APICS SCOR 2017), additional recherche required

3. The concept of mental activity in the Work of G.P. Shchedrovitsky

   __Goal:__ tba.
   
   __Literature:__ (Shchedrovitsky 2014)

4. The concept of management and leadership in the Work of G.P. Shchedrovitsky

   __Goal:__ tba.
   
   __Literature:__ (Shchedrovitsky 2014)

5. Process Improvement Patterns. Exploitative and Explorative Business Process Improvements

   __Goal:__ The aim of all analytical efforts to verbalise business processes
   is to improve them through targeted systemic transformations. _Systemic_
   means the (external and internal) demarcation of an area in the sense of
   our system concept, which is subject to a targeted transformation.
   _Targeted_ means that an "ideal end result" in the sense of TRIZ is to be
   achieved. _Targeted transformation_ means that this goal is prepared and
   evaluated by modelling the system as well as a transition path that is
   subsequently rolled out. Not only Business TRIZ assumes that such
   transformations follow certain Process Improvement Patterns. Corresponding
   theoretical approaches are to be presented and compared.

   __Literature:__ (Rosemann 2020), (Lindskog 2018)

6. Business Innovation in ISO 56000:2020.

   __Goal:__ ISO 56000 "Innovation management – Fundamentals and vocabulary"
   is a newly (in 2020) adopted international standard in which terms and
   concepts for innovation management are standardised at a sufficiently
   general level of abstraction.  The basic concepts and terms are to be
   presented and compared with the terminology developed so far in the
   seminar.

   __Literature:__ ISO 56000

7. Sustainable Business Model Patterns and Anti-Patterns

   __Goal:__ The integration of sustainable goals into business models is of
   high importance to meet the key challenges of today's society, such as
   climate change, social justice and resource scarcity. To this end,
   companies are increasingly resorting to reflect their business model in
   terms of economic, ecological and social responsibility. Business model
   patterns can support this by identifying proven and applicable solutions
   and by helping to identify potential for improvement.  In addition,
   anti-patterns, which represent solutions that are known to have
   shortcomings, can be used to design business models.  An overview of
   existing sustainable business model patterns and anti-patterns has to be
   developed based on a systematic literature review.

   __Literature:__ (Lüdeke-Freund et al. 2018)

8. Service Oriented Business Process Management

    __Goal:__ Classical Business Process approaches are focused on process
    management in production structures where classical products are produced
    that can be sold as tangible goods on the market. In the last 50 years,
    however, production structures for services have gained enormous
    importance. The associated structural change in society, which has taken
    place and is taking place in different ways in all western industrialised
    countries, is also referred to as the __transition to a service
    society__. The lecture will examine and present which differences and new
    aspects arise in the field of BP modelling and management of such
    service-oriented structures.
