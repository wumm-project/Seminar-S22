## Seminar themes:

1. Comparison of central terms of Business TRIZ and the APQC Process
   Classification Framework

2. Comparison of the process models of Business TRIZ and Maturity Models   
   - Process and Enterprise Maturity Model - Michael Hammer
   - Business Process Maturity Model (BPMM) by Bill Curtis and John Alden
   - Business Process Modelling und TRIZ

3. The systematic innovation process of Business TRIZ.

4. Inventive Business Standards. Comparison with classic TRIZ.

5. Process Improvement Patterns. Exploitative and Explorative Business Process
   Improvements

   __Goal:__ The aim of all analytical efforts to verbalise business processes
   is to improve them through targeted systemic transformations. _Systemic_
   means the (external and internal) demarcation of an area in the sense of
   our system concept, which is subject to a targeted transformation.
   _Targeted_ means that an "ideal end result" in the sense of TRIZ is to be
   achieved. _Targeted transformation_ means that this goal is prepared and
   evaluated by modelling the system as well as a transition path that is
   subsequently rolled out. Not only Business TRIZ assumes that such
   transformations follow certain Process Improvement Patterns. Corresponding
   theoretical approaches are to be presented and compared.

   __Literature:__ (Rosemann 2020), (Lindskog 2018)

6. Comparison of central terms of Business TRIZ and Business Innovation along
   ISO 56000:2020.

   __Goal:__ ISO 56000 "Innovation management – Fundamentals and vocabulary"
   is a newly (in 2020) adopted international standard in which terms and
   concepts for innovation management are standardised at a sufficiently
   general level of abstraction.  The basic concepts and terms are to be
   presented and compared with the terminology developed so far in the
   seminar.

   __Literature:__ ISO 56000

7. Sociocracy 3.0 and Business Model Patterns

8. Service Oriented Business Process Management

    __Goal:__ Classical Business Process approaches are focused on process
    management in production structures where classical products are produced
    that can be sold as tangible goods on the market. In the last 50 years,
    however, production structures for services have gained enormous
    importance. The associated structural change in society, which has taken
    place and is taking place in different ways in all western industrialised
    countries, is also referred to as the __transition to a service
    society__. The lecture will examine and present which differences and new
    aspects arise in the field of BP modelling and management of such
    service-oriented structures.

    __Literature:__ (Ford, Mouzas 2013)

9. Sustainability, Triple Bottom Line and the PESTLE Approach im Business
   Models

10. From P-TRIZ to Business TRIZ
