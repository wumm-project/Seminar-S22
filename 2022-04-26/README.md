## Abstract

In the lecture and seminar we had identified "problem solving" as the subject
of TRIZ in particular and of Systematic Innovation Methodologies in general.
In the core of a _systematic-methodical approach_ to problem solving in
cooperative action, general linguistic means are required first to delimit and
describe such problems.

The _concept of system_ is a basic mental tool for delimiting and reducing
problems to their essentials. Such _focussing_ and _contextualisation_ is the
prerequisite for further planful proceeding: for modelling the problematic
situation (D. Mann: "Define"), for selection of suitable solution tools
(D. Mann: "Select"), for generation of solution proposals (D. Mann:
"Generate") and the assessment and selection of suitable solutions (D. Mann:
"Evaluate").

D. Mann stops at this mental stage in his book, which of course must still be
followed by the _implementation_ of the solution - "it is not only about
interpreting the world differently, it is a matter of changing it" (Marx).
The implementation of solutions, however, as a primarily practical-material
process is strongly dependent on domain- and situation-specific conditions.
Nevertheless: "the proof of the pudding is the eating" - only the full
systemic transformation from the should-is comparison of the "system as it is"
to the "should" of the "system as required" and "is" of the "system as it
became" closes the feedback cycle between justified expectations and
experienced results that fundamentally drives the systemic development of the
world.

In this step, in which the system becomes a "living system", the fundamental
contradiction of every systemic approach manifests itself - the contradiction
between the _necessity of decomposition_ for analysis purposes and the
_indecomposability_ as a "living system" in operating mode.

In this transition, the _operating conditions_ given in the _specification_
must be practically produced. The system must be practically connected with
the necessary resources that guarantee the required throughput of substance,
energy and information in a qualitatively and quantitatively determined form.
In short, the system must be integrated (in the sense of _systemic
development_) into its place in an indivisible "living world".

In the seminar, the concept of resources is examined more closely under this
aspect.
