* __Theme:__   On the Notion of a Resource
* __Presenter:__ Hans-Gert Gräbe

## Abstract

In the lecture and seminar we had identified "problem solving" as the subject
of TRIZ in particular and of Systematic Innovation Methodologies in general.
In the core of a _systematic-methodical approach_ to problem solving in
cooperative action, general linguistic means are required first to delimit and
describe such problems.

The _concept of system_ is a basic mental tool for delimiting and reducing
problems to their essentials. Such _focussing_ and _contextualisation_ is the
prerequisite for further planful proceeding: for modelling the problematic
situation (D. Mann: "Define"), for selection of suitable solution tools
(D. Mann: "Select"), for generation of solution proposals (D. Mann:
"Generate") and the assessment and selection of suitable solutions (D. Mann:
"Evaluate").

D. Mann stops at this mental stage in his book, which of course must still be
followed by the _implementation_ of the solution - "it is not only about
interpreting the world differently, it is a matter of changing it" (Marx).
The implementation of solutions, however, as a primarily practical-material
process is strongly dependent on domain- and situation-specific conditions.
Nevertheless: "the proof of the pudding is the eating" - only the full
systemic transformation from the should-is comparison of the "system as it is"
to the "should" of the "system as required" and "is" of the "system as it
became" closes the feedback cycle between justified expectations and
experienced results that fundamentally drives the systemic development of the
world.

In this step, in which the system becomes a "living system", the fundamental
contradiction of every systemic approach manifests itself - the contradiction
between the _necessity of decomposition_ for analysis purposes and the
_indecomposability_ as a "living system" in operating mode.

In this transition, the _operating conditions_ given in the _specification_
must be practically produced. The system must be practically connected with
the necessary resources that guarantee the required throughput of substance,
energy and information in a qualitatively and quantitatively determined form.
In short, the system must be integrated (in the sense of _systemic
development_) into its place in an indivisible "living world".

In the seminar, the concept of resources is examined more closely under this
aspect.

## Notes

The presentation touched on the following issues:

- Darrell Mann's distinction of the four phases Define, Select, Generate,
  Evaluate of a systemic problem solving process was put in relation to the
  concept of a system we have developed so far on the background of TRIZ.
- It was discussed to which extent systemic problem solving is oriented
  towards _pure functionality_ only. The relation to the TRIZ concept of
  Ideality and Ideal Machine was considered.
- The importance of _implementation_ and real-world operation of the solution
  for the feedback loop between _justified expectations_ and _experienced
  results_ was emphasised.  The solution is not to stop at the stage of a
  _solution plan_ alone, as a "conditional mind game".
- Implementation means re-embedding the solution into its context.  In this
  context the _concept of resources_ plays a central role. The availability of
  suitable resources is central for the throughput of material, energy and
  information as an essential living condition of a systemic solution. This
  must early be conceptually incorporated in the solution process.
- It was investigated how the throughput problem is present in the TRIZ
  concepts "minimal technical system, "complete technical system" as well as
  in Substance-Field Modelling.
- Some principal conceptual pairs have been elaborated
  - Pure functionality and state-changing actions
  - Components and Objects in (Szyperski 2002)
  - Operation and maintenance mode of technical systems
