## Abstract

Measurability and measurement also play a major role in Capability-Maturity
approaches such as CMMI in software engineering, but only at a late stage of
maturity (level 4 in CMMI), since only something that is available in a
sufficiently _structured_ form can be measured.

Physics, as one of the oldest "measuring" sciences, teaches that not only the
_structuredness_ of what is being measured is important, but also about the
_interpretation_ of the measurement results.  The close connection between
theory, measurement procedures, measurement results and interpretations is
well known there.

It is also only worthwhile to measure something that in the further (direct or
even only indirect) course has an impact on the process design.

The strategies mentioned in Darrell Mann's text are closely related to the
Class 4 standards of TRIZ Substance-Field (SF) modelling.
