## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   Measurement Standards
* __Presenter:__ Victor JÃ¼ttner

## Abstract

Measurability and measurement also play a major role in Capability-Maturity
approaches such as CMMI in software engineering, but only at a late stage of
maturity (level 4 in CMMI), since only something that is available in a
sufficiently _structured_ form can be measured.

Physics, as one of the oldest "measuring" sciences, teaches that not only the
_structuredness_ of what is being measured is important, but also about the
_interpretation_ of the measurement results.  The close connection between
theory, measurement procedures, measurement results and interpretations is
well known there.

It is also only worthwhile to measure something that in the further (direct or
even only indirect) course has an impact on the process design.

The strategies mentioned in Darrell Mann's text are closely related to the
Class 4 standards of TRIZ Substance-Field (SF) modelling.

## From the Chat

Why measure?  Refer to APQR PCF section (13.6.) if applicable.

What are the prerequisites for measuring?

How are measurement and "objectification" related - see last lecture? 

How are measurement and comparison related?

Should and is - a topic?

Measuring and development? Measuring development?

How to define benefits, costs, harm?

It is often claimed in TRIZ that ideality is a _qualitative_ concept.  Why and
how it can be quantified?

Perceived - what does that mean? Only reducing uncertainty and complexity?
Subjectivity?

Why no arrow Contol -> Process? Isn't the "why" located there?

TRIZ Standards Class 4 - Measurement in Substance-Field Models.  That is where
the approaches (a)-(h) come from. It would make sense to take a closer look.
See (Koltze/Souchkov, chapter 8).

(B) Measure and test. What is the connection? Software testing, for example.

Virtual customer - simulation of processes?

(G) Psychology: Is it measuring? 

(I) Anticipatory Failure Analysis

Change in the photo industry: Is measurement a panacea?

Remember function - does it have anything to do with measurement or with
aggregation of data (pictures)?  What is needed for this? Metadata? Does
metadata have anything to do with measurement? Is measurement always
numerical?

Does measurement always deteriorate ideality?  It consumes resources without
contributing to the value proposition in the strict sense. Even if "project
own resources" are used.
