## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   Measurement Standards
* __Presenter:__ Victor JÃ¼ttner

## Abstract

Measurability and measurement also play a major role in Capability-Maturity
approaches such as CMMI in software engineering, but only at a late stage of
maturity (level 4 in CMMI), since only something that is available in a
sufficiently _structured_ form can be measured.

Physics, as one of the oldest "measuring" sciences, teaches that not only the
_structuredness_ of what is being measured is important, but also about the
_interpretation_ of the measurement results.  The close connection between
theory, measurement procedures, measurement results and interpretations is
well known there.

It is also only worthwhile to measure something that in the further (direct or
even only indirect) course has an impact on the process design.

The strategies mentioned in Darrell Mann's text are closely related to the
Class 4 standards of TRIZ Substance-Field (SF) modelling.

## Notes

Measurements of the performance of labour such as standardisations and
piecework wage only started to play a role with the transition to massively
dissected labour processes at the beginning of the 20th century and the
consideration of workers as exchangeable parts of the industrial machine.
Before that, the worker encapsulated specific, non-formalised procedural
skills and could not simply be replaced by the metaphorical "trained gorilla".

As the division of labour continues to increase and the importance of
procedural skills tied to specific individuals grows, measuring processes
within organisations becomes much more complicated again. Nevertheless,
measurement plays an important role in many Business Process Management
approaches, such as e.g. the
[S.M.A.R.T. approach](https://fitsmallbusiness.com/smart-goals-examples/),
because measurement is associated with a certain "objectification" of
assessments.

However, measurement is rich of prerequisites and regularly leads to a
deterioration of the "ideality" if considered in isolation, since it consumes
resources in a non-productive way. Measurement must therefore always be linked
to a _controlling effect_ that more than compensates for the costs of
measurement. Measurement is thus always embedded in more comprehensive
comparisons of target and actual figures and unfolds its effect during
_operation_ of the organisation and thus only in the "living" organisation
itself.

A distinction must therefore be made between the _planning_ of measurements
and the _evaluation_ of the measurement results, the latter as part of the
_operation_ of the organisation. Measurements are thus an inherent part of
more comprehensive _quality assurance measures_ and must be embedded in such a
framework of a "learning living organisation".

However, _quality assurance_ in organisations is itself prerequisite-rich and
only possible in a clearly structured operational context in which process
modules and templates are abstracted to a suitable extent so that they can be
compared with each other. Capability Maturity Models such as
[CMMI](https://www.quality.de/lexikon/cmmi/) address therefore first the
development of structured process landscapes themselves (maturity levels 1-3).
Measurements and measurement processes can only be set up in such structured
Business Process environments with a meaningful control effect.

Such questions did not play a role neither in Darrell Mann's book nor in the
presentation and discussion in the seminar.

## From the Chat

Why measure?  Refer to APQR PCF section (13.6.) if applicable.

What are the prerequisites for measuring?

How are measurement and "objectification" related - see last lecture? 

How are measurement and comparison related?

Should and is - a topic?

Measuring and development? Measuring development?

How to define benefits, costs, harm?

It is often claimed in TRIZ that ideality is a _qualitative_ concept.  Why and
how it can be quantified?

Perceived - what does that mean? Only reducing uncertainty and complexity?
Subjectivity?

Why no arrow Contol -> Process? Isn't the "why" located there?

TRIZ Standards Class 4 - Measurement in Substance-Field Models.  That is where
the approaches (a)-(h) come from. It would make sense to take a closer look.
See (Koltze/Souchkov, chapter 8).

(B) Measure and test. What is the connection? Software testing, for example.

Virtual customer - simulation of processes?

(G) Psychology: Is it measuring? 

(I) Anticipatory Failure Analysis

Change in the photo industry: Is measurement a panacea?

Remember function - does it have anything to do with measurement or with
aggregation of data (pictures)?  What is needed for this? Metadata? Does
metadata have anything to do with measurement? Is measurement always
numerical?

Does measurement always deteriorate ideality?  It consumes resources without
contributing to the value proposition in the strict sense. Even if "project
own resources" are used.
