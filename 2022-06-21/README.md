## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__   Trimming
* __Presenter:__ Carsten Lehmann

## Abstract

Trimming is a TRIZ approach to simplify an existing system by "trimming"
components, objects or functions. When a component is trimmed, for example,
the functions it performs in the system must be shifted to other components.
Trimming is a typical approach to reduce the complexity of an already mature
system that has built up in the course of systemic development. The aim of the
approach is to make the system easier to understand and maintain. An essential
aspect is the "viability" of the changed system which addresses not only the
functionality but also its operating conditions.

## From the Chat

Darrell Mann has for several topics his own terminology

What is an _element_? It has to be "something with function" (slide 2).

Darrell Mann (p. 124):
> ‘Elements’ is used as a generic term encapsulating people, departments,
> physical components or any other thing that may be found within a system.

- Discussion: Element is a subsystem or component of the system and thus is
  subject to a place-content relation as explained by Shchedrovitsky.

System on a chip -> trend "transition to micro level"?

Lean management? Is this an example of trimmimg or rather a transformation to
a completely different form of organisation?  Where does "trimming" ens and
"disruptive change" starts?

Slide 5: Can processes be trimmed? How are functions and processes related? ->
Slide 15: No, only functions in processes.  Process steps as "elements"?

FAA - what is "attributive analysis"? Classical TRIZ only knows "functional
analysis". Why does Darrell Mann use a different terminology here? How is this
related to Business Process Models?

Slide 6: Trimming there refers exclusively to functions.

"Element or Resource around the system" - What is a resource other than
element and how does this fit with the element concept above?

- Discussion: Element in this sense is a "subsystem outside the system", i.e.
  in my terminology a neighbouring system. We discuss these aspects on the
  example of an API.  The API is the place in the system, the content its
  implementation.  The content may be developed within the system context (but
  has anyway another focus of "reduction to the essential" as the system), but
  may be also imported from the environment. Functionally there is little
  difference, socio-technically a big one, since opertaion and maintenance of
  the "outside content" requires coordinating activites beyond the boundary of
  the system and hece follows the "trend to the supersystem".

Slide 8: Representation as graph, box (labelled node) = element, arrow =
function. This is also used by Howard Smith, as well as in Business Process
Management (BPM) systems. In SF modelling, the nodes are "substances".  Are in
BPM the arrows processes?

Slides 11 and 16: Does the distinction between useful and harmful play a role
in trimming? In particular, what role do _harmful_ functions play in trimming
decisions?

Slide 12: "low-cost resources" - What role do other "values" play, especially
in the context of sustainability?  What does trimming outside the system mean
for the delineation of the system itself?

Slide 17: "Managing situations where elements are functionally coupled" - But
isn't that always the case? Function as an arrow between elements.

Slide 18: What about attributes? 

Slide 17: Viable System Tests - What role does "viable" play? Was also very
important for us, but not for the analysis, but for the operation of the
system, which is only possible in "assembled state".

For Beer, the 5 items are not "conditions" but "levels" that are universal and
constitutive for every system.  Such trimming therefore means "amputation in
the system" (at least so I understand Beer's arguments).  See also the
following slides.

Slide 23: What is the "autopoietic capability" of a system, how do you
recognise it and how does it enter into planning processes (trimming is an
instrument of transformation _planning_)?

Are there significant differences between trimming technical systems and
trimming business systems?
