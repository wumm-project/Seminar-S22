* __Presenter:__ Carsten Lehmann

## Abstract

Trimming is a TRIZ approach to simplify an existing system by "trimming"
components, objects or functions. When a component is trimmed, for example,
the functions it performs in the system must be shifted to other components.
Trimming is a typical approach to reduce the complexity of an already mature
system that has built up in the course of systemic development. The aim of the
approach is to make the system easier to understand and maintain. An essential
aspect is the "viability" of the changed system which addresses not only the
functionality but also its operating conditions.
