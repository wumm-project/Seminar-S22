## Notes

The only point touched upon in the discussion was the question of whether the
historical optimism formulated on slide 15 had any justification at all or
whether every human community - and not only those producing in the various
capitalist ways - had not yet ultimately perished from an overuse of the
available resources.

References to literature, namely studies on historical forms of the management
of commons (E. Ostrom), especially of resources (such as irrigation systems,
dike structures, etc.), which only have an effect as _emergent_ structures,
were dispelled with the remark that this has ever stably functioned over a
more or less long period of time only.

So we may be dealing with a _fundamental contradiction_ between short-term and
long-term processes on different space-time scales. These are questions that
in particular the
[Santa Fe Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute) is
addressing.
