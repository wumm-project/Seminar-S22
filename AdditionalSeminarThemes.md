## Seminar themes

### Comparison of different conceptual systems

- The MOF and CMOF format of OMG for meta model descriptions and BPDM 1.0

  - __Goal:__ OMG is an international, open membership, not-for-profit
    technology standards consortium, founded in 1989. OMG Task Forces develop
    enterprise integration standards for a wide range of technologies and an
    even wider range of industries.  OMG is leading in developing also
    formalised representations for their meta models, in particular the MOF
    and CMOF format for formal representations of meta models.  This was in
    particular applied to a presen tation of BPDM 1.0 - the Business Process
    Definition Metamodel.

  - __Literature:__ (Teuteberg et al.  2009), (O'Leary 2004), (Annane et
    al. 2019), (OMG 2008)

- Comparison of notational basics in the APQC Process Classification Framework
  (PCF), the OMG BPMN 2.0 system and Business TRIZ

  - __Goal:__ APQC - the American Productivity and Quality Center - is an
    important cross industry center conceptualising business and management
    processes. They developed a five level classification system (categories,
    process groups, processes, activities, tasks) for business processes
    within a company. Similar notational systems for meta models were proposed
    with BPMN 2.0 by OMG, and also Business TRIZ uses certain meta model
    elements. In the presentation a comparison of notational basics
    (similarities and differences) should be conducted.

    While BPMN 2.0 is available in a strongly formalised machine-readable
    format this seems not to be the case for (the cross-industry version of)
    APQC-PCF. An essential part of the seminar paper could be a proposal for
    such a formalised presentation of that meta model.
    
  - __Literature:__ APQC’s Process Classification Framework (PCF), (Teuteberg
    et al.  2009), (O'Leary 2004), (Annane et al. 2019)

### Business Process and Business Model Improvements

- Business Capability Maturity Models
  - Michael Hammer
  - Darrell Mann
  - Business Process Maturity Model (BPMM) by Bill Curtis and John Alden
- Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN)
- Decision Model and Notation (DMN)

- Exploitative and Explorative Business Process Improvements

  - __Goal:__ The aim of all analytical efforts to verbalise business
    processes is to improve them through targeted systemic transformations.
    _Systemic_ means the (external and internal) demarcation of an area in the
    sense of our system concept, which is subject to a targeted
    transformation.  _Targeted_ means that an "ideal end result" in the sense
    of TRIZ is to be achieved. _Targeted transformation_ means that this goal
    is prepared and evaluated by modelling the system as well as a transition
    path that is subsequently rolled out. Not only Business TRIZ assumes that
    such transformations follow certain Process Improvement Patterns.
    Corresponding theoretical approaches are to be presented and compared.

  - __Literature:__ (Rosemann 2020), 

- Business Innovation in ISO 56000:2020.

  - __Goal:__ ISO 56000 "Innovation management – Fundamentals and vocabulary"
    is a newly (in 2020) adopted international standard in which terms and
    concepts for innovation management are standardised at a sufficiently
    general level of abstraction.  The basic concepts and terms are to be
    presented and compared with the terminology developed so far in the
    seminar.

  - __Literature:__ ISO 56000

- How to hold strategic sessions via TRIZ tools (A. Kozhemyako)
  <https://bmtriz.ru/how-to-hold-strategic-sessions-via-triz-tools/>
- Inventive Supply Chain Engineering (Alex Sidorec at BTO Fall 2021)  

### Multi-Stakeholder Business Systems

- Conceptual systems and coordination processes in multi-stakeholder business
  systems

  - __Goal:__ Classical business and management strategies which focus on
    managers with sufficient authority, cannot be applied in multi-stakeholder
    environments, where decision meeting is a more complicated process. This
    is also typical for prosumer approaches, where value production is
    distributed between provider and customer. The special features of
    multi-stakeholder oriented concepts compared to classical business process
    approaches are to be worked out.
   
  - __Literature:__ Recherche required

- Coordination Processes in SCOR - the Supply Chain Operations Reference Model

  - __Goal:__ A typical context of distributed business processes is met in
    supply chains.  SCOR extends the classical business process concepts with
    terms that can be used to verbalise, process and evaluate various specific
    problems in such supply chains.  These concepts are to be introduced and
    classified.

  - __Literature:__ (APICS SCOR 2017), additional recherche required

- Agent-based Cooperative Action

- Sustainability, Triple Bottom Line, the PESTLE approach and Business Models

### Business Model Patterns and Anti-Patterns

- Sustainable Business Model Patterns and Anti-Patterns

  - __Goal:__ The integration of sustainable goals into business models is of
    high importance to meet the key challenges of today's society, such as
    climate change, social justice and resource scarcity. To this end,
    companies are increasingly resorting to reflect their business model in
    terms of economic, ecological and social responsibility. Business model
    patterns can support this by identifying proven and applicable solutions
    and by helping to identify potential for improvement.  In addition,
    anti-patterns, which represent solutions that are known to have
    shortcomings, can be used to design business models.  An overview of
    existing sustainable business model patterns and anti-patterns has to be
    developed based on a systematic literature review.

### Service Oriented Business Process Management

- Service Oriented Business Process Management

  - __Goal:__ Classical Business Process approaches are focused on process
    management in production structures where classical products are produced
    that can be sold as tangible goods on the market. In the last 50 years,
    however, production structures for services have gained enormous
    importance. The associated structural change in society, which has taken
    place and is taking place in different ways in all western industrialised
    countries, is also referred to as the __transition to a service
    society__. The lecture will examine and present which differences and new
    aspects arise in the field of BP modelling and management of such
    service-oriented structures.

  - __Literature:__ (Ford, Mouzas 2013)

### Business TRIZ

The aim of this block of seminar themes is to become more familiar with
individual concepts of _Business TRIZ_ and to place them in a broader context
of modelling Business Processes, of Business Models, Problem-solving
strategies and patterns. The starting point in each case is a chapter in
(Mann-2007); further research is required on the connection of the respective
topic to other approaches in order to present commonalities and special
features of Business TRIZ and other modelling approaches.  The standard
reference to classical TRIZ is (Koltze/Souchkov 2017).  For an introduction to
the notions _system_ and _organisation_ see the handout (Graebe 2022b).
