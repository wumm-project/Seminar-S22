# Summer Term 2022

* lecture: th/do 9:15-10:45 SG 3-15 (starts on April 5, 2022) 
* Seminar: tu/di 9:15-10:45 online (starts on April 19, 2022)

The Seminar takes place synchronously online in the BBB room BIS.SIM
<https://meet.uni-leipzig.de/b/gra-w2c-fhz-qnp>.

## Conception

The __seminar__ is part of the seminar module "Applied Computer Science",
which also includes an (optional but strongly recommended) __lecture__.

Additionally an (__fee requiring__) online lab is offered with the TRIZ
trainer of Target Invention.  This is __not__ part of the seminar module. 

The conceptual basis of the lecture and seminar is a _systemic approach to
cooperative action and accompanying descriptive structures_ that are
significant in the real world. As an instrument of complexity reduction, the
_system concept_ is based on a set of viable components whose interaction in
the given systemic context produces a _specific emergent functionality_. An
aeroplane consists of several components, none of them can fly, only the
specific interaction of the parts produces the new function.

This understanding of systems, which is also closely related to the topic of
Component Software in computer science, has many facets. In such systems, not
only the _structure_ but also their _processing_ plays an important role. Such
aspects - a systemically based concept of management, business processes and
business models - were and are in the focus of the seminar.

The seminar is designed as a __research seminar__ in which a number of
colleagues from different institutions participate.  In addition to student
presentations, these staff members will also present their own texts and other
works of current interest to be discussed together. With this seminar, we are
thus offering you the opportunity to participate in our current research work.
In order to ensure a certain cohesion among the seminar topics, the proposed
topics are grouped around a __thematic frame__.

A more detailed study of cooperative action in technologically rooted business
environments is in the focus of the seminar topics this semester.

## A General Theory of Strong Thinking

Another important focus of the course is thinking, analysing and resolving
contradictions. Thinking in terms of contradictions and modelling (initially)
contradictory situations is a fundamental engineering and management
competence, its teaching in the context of a "General Theory of Strong
Thinking" (OTSM-TRIZ) and its further development as the "Innovative Design
Method" (IDM) is at the centre of our teaching programme.

Nikolay Khomenko as one of the founders of the OTSM version of TRIZ points it
this way:
> The course has forced the biggest change in years in my way of approaching
> problems and analyzing them. The majority of the innovative solutions
> proposed by the method are better adapted to a research context where no
> solution is known, then to an industrial context where the desire is to
> reduce the cost of well-known solutions. Nevertheless, the problem analysis
> tools are extremely powerful in all situations. Over time I have noticed
> that the effects of the change in mentality are growing rather than fading
> away.

Ibid, slide 36
> In order to be universal, the rules of problem solving methods should be as
> general as possible. But the more general the rules of problem solving are,
> the more general and the less practical the solution will be. And vice
> versa: when the rules (and methods) are specific and precise, they are
> helpful for solving a specific problem which is of practical use.  However,
> the more specific they are the less universal they are as well.

Ibid, slide 40
> Any problem can be stated as a contradiction between our _subjective
> desires_ for something appearing in a _specific context_ on the one hand,
> and _objective laws_ that cause this specific situation, one the other hand.

Ibid, slide 42
> Any element should be seen as a process and vice versa. This process, which
> is linked with a human being as soon as we are in a problem solving context,
> evolves in accordance with objective laws and takes into account specific
> objective and subjective factors.

## Data protection

We follow an Open Culture approach not only theoretically but also practically
and make course materials publicly available.  This also applies to the course
materials you have to produce (presentations, seminar papers) as well as to
(annotated) chat sessions of the seminar discussions, in which your names are
also mentioned.  We assume your consent to this procedure if you do not
explicitly object.  The discussions themselves are __not__ recorded, but the
chat protocols are published in an edited form.
