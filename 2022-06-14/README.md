## Short Announcement

* __Theme:__ Contradiction Elimination
* __Presenter:__ Immanuel von Detten

## Abstract

Analysis and resolution of conflicting requirements is one of the central
methodological elements of TRIZ.  In chapter 11 of his book Darrell Mann first
introduces the terms trade-off, conflict and compromise. Trade-offs occur when
two evaluation parameters of the system behave in opposite ways when the
conditions are varied - the improvement of one parameter leads to the
deterioration of the other. Compromise means finding the point in phase space
where the trade-off is best tolerated, and ultimately often leads to numerical
parameter optimisation in the (model of the) system itself.

For difficult problems, such optimisation is not sufficient and the question
arises to change the phase space itself by changing the system or its
operating conditions, thus leaving the old constraint of varying the
conditions. For such an "elimination of compromise" in the words of Darrell
Mann, TRIZ has worked out 40 general procedures (principles) to solve such
_technical contradictions_.

"Variation of conditions" in a system can often itself be described by
parameter variation of action (or control) parameters. The functional
dependencies in the corresponding mathematical models are the basis for the
parameter optimisation as _compromise_ described above. Technical
contradictions between two evaluation parameters often can be expressed as
contradictory behaviour of a single action parameter, which at the same time
should take mutually exclusive values.  This suggests a general way to solve
such a _physical contradiction_: refine the modelling by different separation
approaches for the action parameter. This is discussed in more detail in
chapter 12 of the book and the relation to the more extensive list of 40
principles is established.

## From the Chat

In the (preceding) chapter 11, "compromise elimination" is also intensively
discussed and the resolution of _technical contradictions_ is considered
there. The large volume of the chapter stems from the description of the 31
general parameters and the 40 solution principles (inventive principles).

For conflict resolution as discussed in chapter 12 a distinction between
_action parameter_ (e.g., personalisation) and _evaluation parameters_ (e.g.,
reach and richness) should be made.

Slide 4: The contradiction is in the _model_ (and the resulting design of
practice), hence may be due to a _specific_ reduction to essentials that is
inappropriate for the problem.

Slide 6: Darrell Mann only considers action parameters with 0-1 values
(Boolean quantities), but this also works with parameters with larger value
ranges.  This plays a bigger role in technical applications, in business
contexts there seems to be only such 0-1 parameters (A and (not A)).

Slide 8: Koltze/Souchkov (p. 106) considers as points 3 and 4
- Separation in the structure (4 sub-strategies)
- Separation by change of condition (5 sub-strategies)

and subdivides these as indicated (separation in space or time are not
subdivided).  This is also associated there with the 76 Inventive Standards,
which are not considered in Darrell Mann. "Transition to alternative system"
is not considered there.  It would be interesting to cross-check all that with
Darrell Mann's book.

Slide 13: The sub-points come largely from technical TRIZ and would have to be
"creatively" transferred to the business context.  There is a recent work
(Souchkov 2022) on this (besides ch. 11 from the book)
https://wumm-project.github.io/Texts/BusinessPrinciples-en.pdf

Slide 15: Indeed, this is presented inversely in other sources.  But Darrell
Mann is (mentally) always about "reducing" resources, so the closer to zero
the better.

Question: slide 8 - "transition to alternative system", are there examples for
this?

Answer: Yes, this is underpinned by four sub-strategies in the book, but they
are probably largely oriented towards the 10 development trends.
